# HanNoonAR
Capstone Design AR Application at Gachon University

## Introduction
HanNOON is an android application that helps users find out what stores sell
In the past, in order to choose a restaurant in a food alley when many restaurants are gathered, we had to walk around or search through web search and read the text.
But, if we use what we are trying to make, we can identify the restaurant’s representative menu and rating at a glance through the 3D model.
And we can be guided in front of the restaurant by following the 3D model.
